                    <p>To fully enjoy your Dubai desert tour experience, it’s essential to feel comfortable and safe, especially during hot climate. Here are a few suggestions:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Choosing loose-fitting and breathable clothing is best to stay cool in the desert heat—light fabrics such as cotton or linen are ideal.</li>
                        <li>Cover your arms and legs with breathable fabrics to protect against the sun, sand, and insects.</li>
                        <li>Shield yourself from the sun with a wide-brimmed hat, sunscreen, and sunglasses.</li>
                        <li>It is safer to wear closed-toe shoes to protect your feet in the desert.</li>
                        <li>Bring a light scarf or shawl for head and face covering during sandstorms.</li>
                        <li>Layer up with a light jacket or sweater for cooler evenings.</li>
                        <li>Keep your valuable jewelry at home to avoid loss or damage.</li>
                        <li>Carry a small backpack with essentials and a water bottle for hydration.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </>
