Whilst we have put in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to secure and safeguard your Personal Information, we will not be held responsible for any unauthorized access by third parties and we cannot guarantee that the Personal Information provided by you or that is transmitted via this Platform or by e-mail is totally secure and safe. You shall not hold us responsible or liable in case of data breaches caused by action/omissions beyond our reasonable control. We may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks.

                    <p className='para mb-4 mt-2'>
                        If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to DubyDrive.com you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information.

You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action, which we take in response to a request from someone using your e-mail and password. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser's password memory function, as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.
